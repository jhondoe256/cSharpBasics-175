//* Loops Challenges:

//todo: Bronze:
//todo: Write a for loop to print the numbers 500 through 525.
//todo: starting point i = 500; (initialization)
//todo: boolean expression i<=525 (the loop will run as long as this is TRUE)
//todo: it will increment up by one as long as bool value is TRUE
for(int i=500; i <= 525 ;i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Console.WriteLine("== Silver ==");

//todo: Silver:
//todo: Create a for loop to print the numbers from 0-100 by 5's.
for(int i = 0; i<=100;i+=5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);    
}

//todo: Gold:
//todo: Create a for loop to print the numbers 1-100. 
//todo: If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' otherwise print the number.
//todo: If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number. 
//todo: If it's divisible by 5, print 'Buzz', instead of the number. 


//* Challenge
//* Prompt the user for a number to count to from zero
//* Take the input from the user and store it
//* loop all numbers from zero to the number given by the user.
