//* Classes

//* Main component of our program
//* When you define a class you have to define the members that it holds

//todo: This is just a DEFINITION, its not the real data!
//todo: ITS JUST A BLUEPRINT

//* Ex: building a house, we'll know the features after its built

//* Let's make a donut
//* we can make new-instances of a donut
Donut doug = new Donut();
